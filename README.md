# Text-Adventure
An adventure app modeled after the text-based games popular in the 80's and 90's.

### What is a Text Adventure?
Wikipedia describes text adventures (or interactive fiction) as:
"text-based games wherein worlds are described in the narrative and the player submits typically simple commands to interact with the worlds. Colossal Cave Adventure is considered to be the first adventure game, and indeed the name of the genre adventure game is derived from the title. As text-based adventure games reached their peak in popularity in the late 1970s and 1980s,notable text-based adventure titles were released by various developers, including Zork and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Infocom."

### Contributors
This is Java app created through a collaboration of two siblings. The purpose of this app project is to further develop our working knowledge of the programming language, Java, and to simply have something to spend time on together. We decided to create a text adventure app in particular out of the nostalgia of playing the games of that format as children.
